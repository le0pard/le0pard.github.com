Hello my dear friends. After a long silence in the blog, I present to you the result of several months - two FREE books.

The first of these books is ["Working with PostgreSQL: tuning and scaling"](http://postgresql.leopard.in.ua/). This book about [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database: how you can use it, possible solutions with tunning and scaling this database. This is not new book, it is 4-th edition of my book. I added and updated huge amount of information inside this book. Right now this book present only in Russian language.
