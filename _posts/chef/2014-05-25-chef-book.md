Hello my dear friends. After number of articles about Chef I decided to create book about it. And today I released my first draft variant of ["Cooking Infrastructure by Chef"](http://chef.leopard.in.ua/) book. It is free and open source book ([CC-by-NC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)).

It is my second open source book. First book was about PostgreSQL and written in Russian. This book I decided to create in English. What is why I need help of native speakers to find and help me to fix typos inside this book. This will help to make good book about Chef. You can use github pull request system or send me fixes directly on email.

Thanks in advance!
